Class Based Name Display (App.js in src directory)
The purpose of this lab is to practice managing state, and setting up controlled inputs. Remember; in React you don't want to directly manipulate the DOM. All page transformations should be done by manipulating your component's state

We are going to create a React component that has a form with two input fields for a first name, and last name. When the form is submitted we will display the full name on the page.

Functional Component Based Name Display (FunkyName.js in src directory)
The purpose of this lab is to get you more familiar with functional React Components, and the parallels between them and class based Components by having you convert a class based component to a functional Component.
