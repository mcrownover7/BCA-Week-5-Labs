Creating a simple modal popup using the power of conditional rendering! Modal boxes are used all over the web, and are essentially a popup display. You see them quite often with image galleries where you can click a preview thumbnail, and the full size image opens as a popup, or to alert the user of some information, or prompt them to take some action.

A modal is a type of display element that sits on top of the page, and blocks interaction with other elements on the page until it is closed.
